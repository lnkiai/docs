This is a versatile chat flow that allows users to seamlessly switch between various AI modes. It was recreated in Dify, inspired by feature modifications found in ChatGPT and Gemini models.

<Info>
  This application simulates feature modifications found in ChatGPT and Gemini models and was recreated using Dify. It draws particular inspiration from Gemini's Gem, using it as a reference to implement mode-switching functionality.
